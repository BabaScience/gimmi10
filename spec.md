SaaS Mobile Application Specification: Gimmi10
1. Overview
Gimmi10 is a React Native mobile application designed to gamify pushup competitions among friends, groups, and communities. The app leverages computer vision to count pushups in real-time via the device’s camera, fostering social engagement, competition, and fitness tracking. Users can perform pushups anytime during the day, accumulate counts, and compete for daily "Competition Points." The app includes analytics for tracking progress, a multi-tier subscription model (free trial and paid tiers), and a network marketing strategy to encourage user growth through referrals.

2. Objectives
Gamification: Create a fun, competitive environment for pushup challenges.
Ease of Use: Ensure a simple, intuitive UI/UX for seamless user interaction.
Social Engagement: Enable users to connect with friends, form groups, and engage with communities.
Scalability: Support a growing user base with robust backend infrastructure.
Monetization: Implement a freemium model with tiered subscriptions.
User Acquisition: Drive growth through a referral-based network marketing strategy.

3. Functional Requirements
3.1 Core Features
3.1.1 Pushup Counting
Camera Integration: Utilize the device’s front-facing camera to detect and count pushups in real-time using computer vision (e.g., TensorFlow Lite or MediaPipe for pose estimation).
Detects user’s body position and counts a pushup when the chest lowers to a predefined threshold and returns to the starting position.
Provides real-time feedback (e.g., on-screen counter, audio cues like "Pushup 5!").
Handles varying lighting conditions and backgrounds with robust detection algorithms.
Manual Override: Allow users to manually input pushup counts if camera detection fails or is unavailable.
Session Management:
Users can start a pushup session anytime during the day.
Pushups are accumulated throughout the day for daily competitions.
Sessions can be paused and resumed.
3.1.2 Social and Competition Features
Friend System:
Users can add friends via username, email, or QR code.
Push notifications alert friends when a user completes a pushup session.
Groups:
Users can create or join groups (e.g., "Workplace Warriors," "Family Fitness").
Group leaderboards display daily and all-time pushup counts.
Community:
Public community boards for global or regional competitions.
Users can join themed challenges (e.g., "100 Pushups a Day").
Daily Competition:
At midnight (user’s local time), the app calculates the day’s top performer(s) in each friend list, group, or community.
Winners earn Competition Points (e.g., 10 points for 1st, 5 for 2nd, 3 for 3rd).
Points are displayed on user profiles and leaderboards.
Push Notifications:
Notify users when they’re overtaken on a leaderboard, when friends complete sessions, or when a challenge starts/ends.
Customizable notification settings.
3.1.3 Analytics and Progress Tracking
User Dashboard:
Displays daily, weekly, monthly, and all-time pushup counts.
Visual charts (e.g., line graphs, bar charts) to show progress over time.
Metrics include:
Total pushups.
Average pushups per session.
Longest streak (consecutive days with pushups).
Competition Points earned.
Milestone Badges:
Award badges for achievements (e.g., "100 Pushups in a Day," "7-Day Streak").
Badges are shareable on social media or within the app.
